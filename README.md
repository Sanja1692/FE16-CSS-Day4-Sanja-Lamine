Basic exercise 2 
Create an HTML document with a navbar with multiple links. Use CSS3 transition effects for these links to change, for example, their font size and color on hover the mouse on them. Try to create your own resource page, like a template that could be reused later. Be creative and use as many resources as you can.

Advanced Exercise | Photo-album
Create a photo album with 6 pictures. You can choose the theme: food, cars, landscapes, etcs... it must be a 8x8 Grid. 

There should have a gap of about 20px between the grid items. 

Please use the template below to guide you how the album should look like:

Apply a suitable design/approach for images. Feel free to extend the design with a title, navbar, etc. 

Challenge
Challenge | Amazon
First, create your own, simplified version of the amazon.com landing-page, using Flexbox or Flexgrid.

Then, create a page similar to the display-tiles on the product's page and apply dynamic and useful features using CSS3 transition and transform effects (e.g. when the user's pointing device hovers over the display-tiles).

Feel free to modify some elements of the web page (they don't need to be the same as on amazon.com), but try to recreate amazon's style as much as you can for now.
